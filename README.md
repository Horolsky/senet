SENET GAME

Senet is ancient Egyptian 2-player board race game with an element of chance.

Its goals and mechanics are somewhat similar to Backgammon, but lower brunching factor provides opportunities to experiment with AI algorithms for that class of games on a smaller scale. This project is my personal sandbox for learning such algorithms.

Basic game mehanics and AI algos are implemented in C++, while Python package gives a simple CLI and logging to CSV. You can play agains CPU or run multiple autoplays with different settings.
